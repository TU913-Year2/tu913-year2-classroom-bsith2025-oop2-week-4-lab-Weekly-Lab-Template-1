# Using and editing classes
This lab exercise has four objectives:
- To get you started using git and github
- To get you started using the Command Line Interface
- To guide you through a top-down design solution to a problem
- To get you to translate pseudo-code correctly


The two programmes in the repository relate to the class Account and its implementation runBank.py.  runBank.py implements the Account class for two bank accounts, John and Jane Doe.  The class Account has not yet been fully completed, and you are required to do the following:

1.	Clone the repository 
2.	Fully implement the class Account.  This requires you to write up all of the set and gets in the class files.
3.	Fully implement the class Account in the runBank.py program.  The program is only partially written; you will need to complete the code so that in the runBank program, you will be able to :
•	Make a withdrawal from each account, 
•	Make a lodgement to each account
•	Have the withdrawal/lodgement reflected in the balance to the account, and finally 
•	Print the details of each account.

For every completed part:

**Clone a repository**	git clone "your-repo-url"

**Stage all changes:**	git add .

**Commit with a meaningful message:**	git commit -am "Completed Part A"

**Push to GitHub:**	git push origin main
